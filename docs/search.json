After a long agency tenure working with nationwide retailers I’m now seeking to leverage data and analytics in the non-profit/public service sector.\nI’m a big fan of getting granular with data to discover what individual points can teach us about our larger big picture narratives. Connecting real world experiences to database representation is the key to storytelling with data!\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nMy wife and I live with our 2 sons in the Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago, where we are forever teaching our kids the right number of bikes to own is n+1."
